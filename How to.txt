How to use the server and client

<<Server>>
1. Install python 3 in your system:
   Make sure that python 3 is installed in your system

2. Install the required dependencies using this command:
   pip install requests

3. Add your API key:
   Replace the API key from the AviationStack website into the get_data function

4. Running the server:
   Run the Server by saving it in a file called 'Server.py' and hitting enter in the terminal
   to run the code using this command:
   python3 Server.py
   With that the server will be working.

<<Client>>
1. Running the Client:
   To run the client the same way as the server, save the file and name it 'Client.py',
   then open a new terminal and run the client using the command:
   python3 Client.py
   and with that the Client will be working.

2. Interacting with the GUI in the client:
   As soon as you run the Client, the GUI will pop up and the user will utilize it to
   intercat with the server.
   The user will make use of the buttons to acquire the needed flight information.
   The user will have to make sure that it follows what it shows on the screen for 
   any required inputs such as the airport ICAO or the IATA for the flight.
   When the user wishes to quit, they can click on the quit button to disconnect.

-- Make sure that the server is running first before you run the client.
